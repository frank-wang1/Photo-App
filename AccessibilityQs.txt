Were React’s compilation warning/error messages helpful?Yes, they were very helpful. It made debugging the code much simpler since most of the times its suggestion would solve the error.Did React’s compilation warning/error messages prompt you to consider making your site more accessible?Yes, React’s suggestions helped make useful suggestions which made implementing accessibility easier.Did you consider conducting accessibility testing on your lab assignment? Why or why not?Yes, using the WAVE extension, because it is very helpful for identifying accessibility issues.If you tested your site for accessibility and found issues, were you able to solve them? What did you do to try to solve them? What stopped you from successfully resolving or trying to resolve the issues?I was able to solve some of them, because either the rest had to be implemented that way or it was too difficult to fix. My limited exposure to React made it more difficult to do so.
