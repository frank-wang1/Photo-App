What corrections did you have to make?
	We added alt text to the all of the images to make them more accessible when the actual image is not generated. 
	This included adding unique alt text to every image. Additionally we changed colors of fonts in order to pass contrast requirements by making grey and blue fonts darker.

Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why or why not? 
	No,because the user generated content can generate colors that donâ€™t necessarily pass the contrast requirements.

Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not? 
	No, because the CSS controls many important aspects of the website, such as the clickable buttons and links. 
	Without CSS, the website would also not look anywhere near the way it does now, and there would be no stylistic features.

Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not? 
	Yes, because the alt text describes what each image is. So, without the actual image, the page is still usable since there is a description.
